## About
We are an agency owned by mom's for moms. We homeschool, own our own online companies and collaborate at every turning point. We understand that 2 brains are better than one and that getting paid is better than getting the recognition. We are typically behind the scenes making our cohort look great in front of an audience. Ted talks or Oprah interview, we are for hire and have done it all!
